Ozbah Project (IN PROGRESS)
--------------------------

Ozbah (العزبة) means a place (room, garden... etc) where a friends and family usually hangout. 

The application is dedicated to arrange who have the right to play on the next game (any game of 2 or 4 players) and arrange the current and waiting list players. based on the time the presence of the player.
where the losing team will move to the end of the waiting list and the first players will jump to current list.

This application was developed mainly for my friends and family when I found that when there are so many people at the same place they usually missed their game or when 2 expert players arrange with each other every time. 

To avoid these situations I developed this application (where all these rules were written and approved by all members of our Ozbah).
